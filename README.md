# hw-week6-weather-dashboard
Joe Schlick's week 6 homework assignment:

This projects creates a browser-based weather app. When the user enters a city name in the input field, the app will return current weather conditions and a 5 day forecast for that city.

The app will store the names of the cities that have been searched as buttons. When a button is pushed, the weather data for that city appears.
